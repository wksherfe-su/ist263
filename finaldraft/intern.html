    <h1>Industry Garage Overview</h1>
    <p>Industry Garage is a composites manufacturer focused on ecommerce-based sales and in-house conversions. After meeting the owner at the company open-house, I kept in contact and was offered an ‘internship’ the following year. Upon arrival for my internship, I was told we would be building a full carbon fiber tesla powered Datsun that would be on display at the CSF radiators booth at SEMA; SEMA is the largest automotive tradeshow in the US, located in Las Vegas. The Datsun project began its new life as a bare chassis with crash damage and rusted out frame rails. The aesthetics of the car were designed by the collective @makehastecorp with collaborative design input from Tim Hicks (owner of Industry Garage) regarding manufacturability. </p>

    <h1>Coolant Fitting</h1>
    <p>My initial individual project was redesigning a coolant fitting for the motor due to the OEM one leading straight into the rear control arm. With no technical drawing or existing CAD online to base the redesign off of, dial calipers were used to measure the existing dimensions. Utilizing SOLIDWORKS, the new fitting was designed with the outlet shooting off the motor at an angle, out of the dynamic range of the control arm.  Following design, I contracted a local connection of mine for SLA resin printing of the fitting fat one third of the price that online contract printers were quoting.</p>

    <h1>Composite Components</h1>
    <p>With the car having a wide fender design, full scale models of the design had to be made in order to manufacture the composite parts. The process begins with creating a ‘plug’ of the intended geometry. For this, I undertook the task of slicing all the CAD files utilizing Prusa slicer and then 3d printing components piece by piece (1300+ hours of printing for all the panels). These prints were epoxied together and required finishing work was done with automotive body filler and primer. With the plug finished, a negative mold of the panel could be constructed. This is done by first waxing the plug, then coating the mold with a water soluble ‘PVA’ release agent (which is applied with a typical primer gun), and then lastly, a tooling gelcoat is applied (the gelcoat captures the surface of the plug so the final carbon part later on has an identical surface finish). When the gelcoat has cured, fiberglass is laid on top with polyester resin, leading to a rigid mold.  ~8 hours later when resin has hardened, the mold can be removed with the help of compressed air and/or water to dissolve the PVA. The mold is prepped for carbon layup the same way as the plug was; wax, PVA and this time clear gelcoat (this fills any pinholes/voids in the surface layer carbon. Carbon fiber fabric is then laid on the gelcoat and wet out with epoxy resin, allowing for a more flexible/durable final part. A Nylon peel ply is laid on the carbon following the last layer of carbon and then followed by a bleeder cloth. The peel ply allows excess resin through it to be absorbed by the bleeder cloth without sticking to the carbon. Lastly a bag is enclosed around the mold and folded into the edges of the mold as vacuum is pulled. ~8 hours later, there is a durable lightweight carbon fiber part that can be released with air and/or water. </p>

    <h1>Taillight Design</h1>
    <p>while compiling photos i found this project which i forgot to include in my copy document. So I will have a description written for the final draft</p>
