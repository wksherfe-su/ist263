        <h2>Work Life</h2>
        <p>
            Currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree for Mechanical Engineering; I’m a senior with a focus on CAD based work in the manufacturing field.
        </p> 
        <p>
            I intend to integrate creative interests with work through the automotive industry and have done so with organizations like <strong>Cuse Motorsports (Syracuse University’s FSAE team)</strong> as well as an internship at a composites company, <strong>Industry Garage.</strong> As the Chief Engineer on the FSAE team, I oversee all operations regarding design and fabrication of components for an open wheel race car. At Industry Garage, I worked on the construction/fabrication of a full carbon fiber Datsun which was on display at SEMA, the largest automotive tradeshow in the US.
        </p>
        <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
        <p>
            My interests and hobbies outside of work include snowboarding, photography, motorsports and other automotive related events.
        </p>
