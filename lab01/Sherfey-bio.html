        William Sherfey. Currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree for Mechanical Engineering; I’m a senior with a focus on CAD based work in the manufacturing field. I intend to integrate creative interests with work through the automotive industry and have done so with organizations like Cuse Motorsports (Syracuse University’s FSAE team) as well as an internship at a composites company, Industry Garage. At Industry Garage, I worked on the construction/fabrication of a full carbon fiber Datsun which was on display at SEMA, the largest automotive tradeshow in the US. Outside of work, my interests include snowboarding, photography, motorsports and other automotive related events."
