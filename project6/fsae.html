    <h1>Syracuse FSAE Overview</h1>
    <p>The Society of Automotive Engineers hosts collegiate competitions where students around the world work to design, build and compete whilst following rules/guidelines. It is an engineering competition as much as it is a driving competition. These programs provide experience unlike any other, preparing the members for industry work and being great talking points for Interviews</p>
    <h2>CAD to Reality</h2>

    <h2>Chassis Design</h2>
    <p>Although I did not have the opportunity to build a ground up chassis in my time at Syracuse, I hosted workshops where I taught members the tools necessary to do so, including CAD and welding.

    The space frame chassis is constructed out of 1” diameter carbon steel of various wall thicknesses following the SAE guidelines. Using Autodesk Inventor, frame generation tools can be used to streamline the CAD process. First, a skeleton file or wireframe sketch is made using 2d sketches on reference planes and 3d sketches to tie in nodes between the 2d sketches. This skeleton is then used in frame generator where you select individual frame members and pick from tubing options that meet your requirements. Notches and Miters can be added at the intersections after generation of the frame members.

    <h1>Tab Redesign</h1>
    <p>Weld failure occurred on the front bell crank tabs while testing the car, and I undertook the task to CAD, cut and weld new tabs on the car in just three days. The front of the car was significantly higher than the rear so without needing to rebuild the push rods, the tabs were redesigned to relocate the bell crank where it ultimately lowered the car. These were plasma cut from 1/8” carbon steel and I tig welded them to the chassis.</p>
    
    <h2>Front Bell Crank Tabs</h2>

    </div>
    
    <h2>Rear Top Shock Tabs</h2>
    <p>Another tab redesign was done for the rear coil-over mounts which had a binding issue; they were mounted 90 degrees from the direction that the coil-overs rotated under compression. This led to inaccurate data when testing so it was deemed a high priority during the winter downtime. New tabs were designed to be bent in-line with the bell crank mounts allowing for proper rotation under compression. These were tig welded and are ready for testing.</p>

    <h1>Caliper Upgrade</h1>
    <p>We upgraded to larger brake calipers and had to redesign the caliper bracket. will add more text later; this was not on the copy document</p>

    <h1>Composite Components</h1>
    <p>The nose cone covers the chassis, protecting the driver from debris on track while also guiding air around the chassis. Despite this, the nose cone is not an aerodynamic device according to the rules as its intent is not creating downforce.
        Design considerations included any rules regarding dimensions/edge radii as well as the fact that the nose cone front volume needed to account for the foam impact attenuator, not yet installed on the car. Overall, it was designed to be as tight against the frame as possible, making mounting points more manageable. 
        <br><br>
        With a relatively low budget and timeline being less than three weeks during winter break, the nosecone was constructed using resources from my internship at <a href="intern.html">Industry Garage</a>. Rather than contracting a 5 axis CNC to cut the foam plug, 2” thick insulation foam sheets were used with intentions of using a 3 axis CNC router. For this to work, the SOLIDWORKS model had to be cut on planes every 2” and the larger of the 2 profiles was sent to the CNC with registration holes cut through the center. After Cutting the profiles, the layers were aligned with metal tubing through the registration holes and then glued together with 3M Super 77 foam adhesive. The front three layers were CNC cut contours so that the forward-facing edges had the appropriate radii. Due to time restrictions, it was faster to shape the remaining contours with bodywork tools than running the CNC with the contour paths. Automotive body filler and primer were used for finishing work although I would not recommend this due to some chemical reaction/complications experienced.
        <br><br>
        Then, following the Composite process explained in greater detail here (link), the plug was waxed, coated with PVA/tooling Gelcoat and covered in fiberglass. The next day, the mold was removed and prepped using you guessed it, wax, PVA and this time clear gelcoat. With the complexity of this geometry, templates of the side profiles were made from the plug using vacuum bag material. These were used to cut the carbon to fit. The carbon was laid in the mold, wet out with resin, covered with peel ply, followed by bleeder and then bagged with the bag templates going into the cavity while a larger envelope-type bag went around the exterior. The next day, the part was removed and trimmed to fit around control arm mounting tabs on the chassis. 
        <br><br>
        Additional chassis covers were made using flat carbon panels which were made on glass panels using the same lay-up process.
